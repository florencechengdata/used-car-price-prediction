# used-car-price-prediction
This is one of the datasets used in my course project. Originally, I analyzed the data using R, and now I am demonstrating it using Python code. The main purpose of this analysis is to identify the relationship between the response variable and explanatory variables through the results and visualizations. It may provide some hints for non-linear or multiplicative regression models.
